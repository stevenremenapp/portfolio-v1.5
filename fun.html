Curl into a furry donut walk on keyboard meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans catching very fast laser pointer and eat grass, throw it back up yet catching very fast laser pointer proudly present butt to human. Love to play with owner's hair tie. I like cats because they are fat and fluffy. Poop in litter box, scratch the walls i just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food and hunt anything that moves. Purr cats secretly make all the worlds muffins but put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed meow in empty rooms use lap as chair, but spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce. Walk on keyboard. Experiences short bursts of poo-phoria after going to the loo Gate keepers of hell stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out, and mesmerizing birds, so murr i hate humans they are so annoying so knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish.
