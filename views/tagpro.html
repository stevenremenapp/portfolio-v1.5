        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <a class="anchor" id="intro"></a>
        <p>I worked on this project as the only frontend developer on the team, which initially included a backend developer and project architect, and later included a designer and quality assurance tester. I also unexpectedly worked as the initial designer for the application because the original designer didn't deliver what was expected. We were hired by the client to create their vision of a "Home Servicing Social Networking Platform." With a background as an owner of a successful custom cabinet business, the client was frustrated in many ways with sites like Thumbtack, Home Advisor, and Angie's List, and also wanted to add an element of Pinterest-like inspiration seeking to the site. It is from this point that we started working with the client to flesh out their ideas into a project they could launch to both home service professionals and consumers seeking home professionals. The project is set for beta release to the initial home professionals soon.</p>
        <h2>TOOLS</h2>
        <a class="anchor" id="tools"></a>
        <p>We are using Vue for the frontend, Go for the backend, Firebase for authentication, and Firestore for data storage, all set on the Google App Engine environment. Specifically, my work on the frontend leverages Vue, Vuex, Vue Router, BootstrapVue, and Firebase Authentication to deliver the TagPro single page application. I handled deploying to our dev, QA, and production environments on Google App Engine using the GCloud command line tool.</p>
        <h2>DEEP DIVE</h2>
        <a class="anchor" id="deep-dive"></a>
        <p>I'm diving into a few of the more interesting parts of this project below; continue reading to learn more.</p>
        <div class="content-list">
          <h3>Design</h3>
          <a class="anchor" id="deep-dive-design"></a>
          <p>The plan was to start out with a designer providing wireframes from the beginning, but it didn't happen and development proceeded. I ended up stepping in as the initial UI designer for the application, with direction from the client that they liked the Pinterest gridded layout, but they preferred it with sharper edges. I started out designing the homepage and public pages first, and will detail that evolution below.</p>
          <p>Initial design inspirations:</p>

            </a>
            <figcaption><span class="caption-icon">&#x3e;&#x3e;&#x3e;</span>The grid that the client particularly liked.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Unfortunately I don't have any screenshots of the original homepage, but it was largely a grid comprised of projects with a much larger (and uglier!) hero section than the redesigned version. I have a couple of shots of the original dashboard and the corresponding public page for that project created in the pro's dashboard. I used the grid for images throughout the app and separated important info and action items into columns.</p>

            <figcaption><span class="caption-icon">&#x3e;&#x3e;&#x3e;</span>The initial design of the pro's dashboard, where they could update their professional profile and create projects. This is the project creation page.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure>
            <a href="/img/tagpro-old-public-page.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

          </figure>
          <p>I felt fortunate to be able to struggle through trying to design the UI for this application and also to have a professional designer step in and redesign it. Although it was a lot of effort right at the end of the project to redesign everything, it was so helpful to see what changes were made, and why. It resulted in a good learning experience for me and a better result overall.</p>
          <p>Below are the same pages as above, but redesigned:</p>

          </figure>
          <h3>Search</h3>
          <a class="anchor" id="deep-dive-search"></a>
          <p>From the beginning we knew that search would be an integral part of this application, and we followed Thumbtack's lead of matching pros and projects to specific service type keywords. The project architect made the decision that GeoJSON search results wasn't necessary at this point in the project, so we designed search around a specific dictionary of service keywords and a limited set of filters that differed based on whether the user searched pros or projects. I matched the search results grid to the homepage grid and paginated to 30 results shown at once. When the user clicks "View More Results" another 30 result cards are added to the bottom of the grid, until the end is reached. I also implemented stateful search based on the queries in the URL so that if the user decided to press forward or back in their browser, or they were sent a search link URL, it would return the appropriate results.</p>
          <figure>
            <a href="/img/tagpro-search.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              <img src="/img/tagpro-search.png" alt="Image of the TagPro search results page.">
            </a>
            <figcaption><span class="caption-icon">&#x3e;&#x3e;&#x3e;</span>The search results page, using lorem ipsum data.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Perhaps the most interesting part of the redesign for me was the inclusion of a custom search component that autocompleted the user's search input and allowed them to choose a search keyword for either a pro or project search. I used fuse.js, rather than explicitly matching strings to give the user some leeway with spelling their inputs. Similar to Thumbtack's implementation, without choosing a matching keyword the user could not complete a search. I built this component from scratch, and used <a href="https://autocomplete.trevoreyre.com/#/vue-component" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trevor Eyre's Vue autocomplete component</a> to handle the autocomplete dropdown functionality. I learned a lot in building out this component, and it helped me refactor the original separate search inputs into one portable search component.</p>

            <figcaption><span class="caption-icon">&#x3e;&#x3e;&#x3e;</span>The custom search component on TagPro's homepage.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h3>Tagging</h3>
          <a class="anchor" id="deep-dive-tagging"></a>
          <p>Tagging (or favoriting) pros, projects, and photos was always part of the client's vision from the beginning. We created a set of tagging APIs that I can call to in order to take the correct actions for the user. I was initially using an ugly plus symbol that changed color based on tag status, but the designer moved toward badges in the banner elements and a badge (un-tagged) and circle indicator (tagged) in card elements to indicate tag status. My initial implementation of the redesign also waited for the API call to be returned before switching the UI, but the designer said it should happen immediately, so I modified the API calls to switch immediately and only return to the original state if the call could not be completed.</p>
          <p>The image below shows the public professional profile page with a variety of tag indicators in the banner and card elements. The untagged badge in the card elements only shows on hover for large screens and is always present on smaller screens.</p>
          <figure>
            <a href="/img/tagpro-pro-page.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

            </a>
            <figcaption><span class="caption-icon">&#x3e;&#x3e;&#x3e;</span>The professional profile page with a variety of tag buttons/indicators.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h3>Dashboard &amp; Public Pages</h3>
          <a class="anchor" id="deep-dive-dashboard"></a>
          <p>The dashboard was a good challenge for me because professionals and consumers have different priorities within the application and it had to flexible enough to share as many components as possible while also allowing differing functionality. For example, consumer users' main functionality is around tagging items and tracking the professionals they've contacted, while professional users are allowed to create a business profile, create projects, have their projects rated, and more. The organization of each type of users' dashboard reflects these priorities while maintaining a consistent UI. I also gave some care to considering how users unfamiliar with the application (read: everyone, because it's new) would require some instruction around what certain actions are, and when they can do them (professionals must complete their business profile before creating projects). I wish I had more time to dedicate to this aspect of the application, but I accomplished this by using permanent and non-intrusive instructional text combined with state-based alerts indicating required actions (particularly for professional users).</p>
          <p>The public pages (i.e. the pro's business profile page and any project pages for the project's they publish) aggregate a public-friendly set of the data input by the pro in their dashboard related to their profile and projects. The goal was to make them attractive and photo-friendly so that professionals might share them as a portfolio. Users can find these pages by browsing the mainpage or by matching search keywords.</p>
          <p>I'm not adding photos of the public pages because there are screenshots for them above and there's no need for this to be longer. The screenshot below shows the home of the pro's dashboard, which allows them quick access to anything they might need to accomplish.</p>

        <h2>PROCESS</h2>
        <a class="anchor" id="process"></a>
        <div class="content-list">
          <h3>Initial Mock Up of TagPro</h3>
          <p>We started with the understanding that the client wanted to make a Thumbtack-like site that also incorporated the look, feel, and basic "pin" functionality of Pinterest. The client also sent along sites which had a look and feel that they liked. From this I started mocking out ideas using pencil and paper, and exploring pre-made Vue theme templates. Soon we realized that this would be a custom front-end and I started building out the initial version of various pages using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-api-mocker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mocked API data</a><span style="text-shadow: none;">.</span> From the beginning I built the design around Pinterest-like grids where possible. Soon after I added the beginning of the login system using Firebase and deployed it to the Google App Engine environment using Go functions to return mock data.</p>
          <h3>Feature Development</h3>
          <p>Feature development typically followed a standard pattern:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Solidify feature requirements with the client.</li>
            <li>Collaborate with the backend developer and project architect to flesh out how to achieve the feature. Agree on a general direction for the feature.</li>
            <li>Collaborate with the backend developer to create a design document which detailed the API endpoints, data structure and storage, basic UI requirements and mock ups, and actions of the frontend that would use the APIs.</li>
            <li>Once the design document was approved by the project architect, we set to building out the feature based on those requirements.</li>
            <li>Once we had enough built out to try out the feature's functionality, the backend developer and I would collaborate on a deployment to our dev environment. We would test it out and iterate on fixes as needed, until it was functioning as expected.</li>
            <li>Move on, but return to iterate on the feature as necessary. Sometimes we would need to update past features in order to accommodate new features or unforeseen issues resulting from our initial feature design.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Client Meetings</h3>
          <p>The project was malleable from the beginning because the client's vision continued to change as we built out the project. As the frontend developer and initial designer I had frequent meetings with the client, especially at the beginning of the project as I was working to establish the overall look of the application. The client was frequently involved in testing the application, especially initially, and also helped manage a Trello task board. Client meetings were spaced further out as we all got more settled with the project, but they continued to be a fairly regular part of our iterative cycle. In addition to meetings, I also sent out release notes to the client to update them on the changes we made with each version deployment.</p>
          <h3>Final Redesign</h3>
          <p>I am not a designer. Shocking, I know. I was open with everyone involved in the project about this from the beginning. So with about two months left on the project, the client contracted a talented designer to redesign the site. After a few weeks, files started coming through in a Zeplin workspace and I could get to work. This meant a complete redesign of the design system I had set up, to take place over the timespan of a month. It was stressful at times, and involved creating new components (such as the custom search component), but it was definitely worth it because the application looks better and is more intuitive.</p>
          <h3>QA Testing</h3>
          <p>A QA tester joined the team in the last few months of the project as we approached the beta release. I worked with him to catch him up on the frontend of the app, and then continued to collaborate with him as he tested the application. He used our Trello task board to create cards for the issues he found, and then those were prioritized by the project architect and developers. Once prioritized, I worked to fix the discovered bugs and release updated versions of the application, along with the backend developer.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <a class="anchor" id="conclusion"></a>
        <p>This was a challenging and rewarding project to work on. From learning the basics of Figma to handle the initial design, to collaborating with the backend developer and the project architect to create design documents and APIs for each feature, to holding regular meetings with the client to make sure the application is achieving what they want it to, to working with a QA tester to refine the project and fix bugs as possible, to moving toward beta release, we have been able to take this project from idea to implemented application on time and on budget. There is certainly room for improvement and expansion, but for now we will see how the release goes.</p>
